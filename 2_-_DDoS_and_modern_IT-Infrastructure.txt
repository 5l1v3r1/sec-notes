DDoS and modern IT-Infrastructure

Edit: 2018-06-02

OK, here is Part II of ‘Why not dosing?’... ;-)
Time to say something to ‘DDoS’ (Distributed-Denial-of-Service-Attack) and modern IT-Infrastructure...
As I explained in “Why not dosing?”, a normal DoS doesn’t do what you may think it does...
So why not make a DDoS ???
So there ‘exist at least tools’ that claim to make a DDoS...
Or, if you wanna have it easier, you can ‘rent/buy a DDoS-Attack in the Darknet’...
So there is still the question: Why not make a DDoS ???
Because: You should understand modern IT-Infrastructure!
As I explained in “Why not dosing?”, some (D)DoS-Attacks can be handled by software on a web-server...
...bigger attacks are more difficult to handle by the web-server...
...and can lead to a “hang” of the server - what should be the goal of a DDoS!
And there comes the modern IT-Infrastructure (modern IT) in the game!
Modern IT like the ‘firewalls from Palo Alto Networks’ can handle a DDoS!
So the best thing that can happen is, that the web-server is not reachable (as long, as you pay the DDoS)!
A “crash” of the web-server is unlikely!
The page(s) will be immediately up again, after you stop the DDoS!
So what’s really happened: Not much !!! ^^
