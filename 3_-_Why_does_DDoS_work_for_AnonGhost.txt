Why does DDoS work for AnonGhost

Edit: 2018-06-02

OK, after we talked about ‘Why DDoS not work’, we can now talk about “Why does DDoS work for AnonGhost ???”... ^^ :D

First, the targets:
AnonGhost don’t target small pages/server, where a outage isn’t so bad, because the page have just some hundred visitors a day.

Second, the size of the attack:
AnonGhost coordinate the DDoS-Attacks in this way, that even web-sites with large infrastructure can’t handle it anymore!

Third, the duration:
Compared with a DDoS-Attack you can buy in the Darknet, that maybe takes an hour, AnonGhost have an eye on it that the outage is really long and really hurds the target!

That’s the reasons, why DDoS (still) works for AnonGhost in Ops like ‘OpIsrael’.
