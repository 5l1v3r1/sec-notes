Easiest solution: Take a open (free) on!

There are new laws in Germany...

In Germany 'Freifunk-Karte'...
...and 'OpenSignal'.

What is 'Wardriving'?

Wardriving:

When you do already wardriving, then you can also do something for the community... ;-)
'Mozilla Stumbler' - haves also a 'nicer map'...

Unforanatly wardriving needs a lot of battery!

After wardriving you can have a look at the map of 'WiGLE WiFi'...
...then you can filter with the magnefier...
...and deselect 'Show Funkmasten'...
...and deselect 'Show WEP'...
...and deselect 'Show WPA'...
...and show the rest...
...and select at the bottem 'All' by 'Show found networks on the map'...
...and 'Found since 2001'...
...and 'Wolla' !!! ^^

Find a open WiFi or hack one.

With a foreign WiFi you can:
- Participate to a DDoS
- Hack other Networks
- Hack the Network of the WiFi
