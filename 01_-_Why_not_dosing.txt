Why not dosing

Edit: 2018-05-31, 2018-06-02

Why not dosing? It’s so easy!

Because you should understand modern web-servers and modern IT-Infrastructure!
Modern web-servers have a web-based ‘web-hosting-control-panel’ (WHCP) like ‘Plesk’ or even ‘cPanel’.
In this WHCP is/or ‘can easily be installed’ a program called ‘Fail2ban’.
Fail2ban is a ‘Intrusion prevention software’ (IPS).
This IPS protects you from ‘brute-force attacks’.
It also protects you from a (Distributed) ‘Denial of Service (attack)’ (dosing).
Normally you run immediately in a so called “Jail”.
If you be jailed means, that your ‘IP (address)’ comes on a blacklist and get further ignored (e.g. 24h).
By this ‘blacklisting’ also your IP gets logged.
This log can later be used by the police.
If you don’t use a ‘Virtual Private Network’ for this, this can brings you in trouble.
End if if you use it - besides that the server is _for_you_ not reachable - nothing happens!

There would be more to say about Hardware-Firewalls and DDos-Protection, but maybe later more... ;-)
